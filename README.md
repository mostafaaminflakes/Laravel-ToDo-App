# Laravel-todo-app

-   This is the basic to-do app with authentication inherited as a part of a testing process for **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.
-   The repo uses **GitHub actions** to sync the app with a **DigitalOcean droplet**.
-   The droplet has **Ububtu** linux with Docker installed and configured.

### Note:

The ToDo App is from [parthp1808](https://github.com/parthp1808/Laravel-todo-app) repo, as this is a test for docker containerized app.
